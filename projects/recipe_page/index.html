                    Measure the golden syrup, lye water, and vegetable oil accurately with a kitchen scale (according to the recipe below). Mix well until combined.
Sift the flour, then add it all at once to the mixture.
Use a fork or stainless steel whisk to bring the ingredients together.
 At first, the mixture will be difficult to combine, but after a few stirs, the liquid will start to absorb into the flour, forming a sticky mass. Continue mixing until a soft dough forms and no dry flour remains in the bowl.
Cover the dough with cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. This resting period allows the dough to relax, making it more elastic and easier to handle. A relaxed dough is less likely to crack or break during shaping and wrapping.
