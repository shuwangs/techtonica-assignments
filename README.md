# techtonica-assignments

This repository contains projects, exercises, and assignments completed as part of the **[Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/) Software Engineering Program** Part time Session 1.

The work here reflects my learning progress across:
- Web development fundamentals
- JavaScript and React
- Backend concepts (APIs, databases)
- Software engineering best practices

Each folder represents a specific assignment, project, or learning milestone during the program.

> Note: Projects are built for learning purposes and may evolve over time.
