🌕 Recipe Page Demo Walkthrough Script

👋 “Hi everyone, my name is Shu, and this is my Recipe Page project — How to Make a Good Mooncake.”

🧁 “I built this page using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
It’s a fully responsive webpage that works on both desktop and mobile.”

🔹 “At the top, I have a navigation bar with my project logo and links.
Then, there’s a short description introducing mooncakes — a traditional Chinese pastry for the Mid-Autumn Festival.”

(Scroll to the description as you say this.)

⏲️ “Next, these cards show the prep time, total time, and servings.
I used Bootstrap’s grid system here for easy layout control.”

🍰 “On the left side, I have the ingredients section, and on the right, the step-by-step instructions.
I also added an image and an embedded YouTube video for a more visual experience.”

(Show the image and scroll to the iframe.)

💻 “For interactivity, I used JavaScript DOM manipulation.
For example, a new ingredient — ‘Salted duck egg yolk’ — is added automatically when the page loads.”
(Point at that item.)

“Each dough ingredient now has a checkbox that I created dynamically with JavaScript,
so users can check off ingredients as they prepare them.”
(Click a few boxes.)

“And if you click the description here, it adds a strikethrough effect — showing event handling in action.”
(Click the paragraph to show the style change.)

💬 “At the bottom, I added a contact form and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub, so users can reach me easily.”

🎨 “Overall, this project demonstrates my understanding of:
HTML structure, Bootstrap layout, responsive design, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.”
