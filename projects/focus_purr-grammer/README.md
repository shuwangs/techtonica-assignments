# Focus! Purr-grammer
A fast-paced React game where you play as a coding cat. The goal is simple: Fix bugs and resist the urge to play!


## 🎮 Game Logic 
Unlike traditional falling-object games, this game simulates the life of a focused programmer cat. The scoring logic is reversed to match the theme:
- CATCH the "Bad" Things (Fixing Bugs)🟢
- AVOID the "Good" Things (Distractions) 🔴
